There are three components to the project, the first component being support to Kenya National Highways Authority (KeNHA) to upgrade the urban road transport infrastructure. This component will involve: constructing and rehabilitating non-motorized transport facilities, including foot paths, cycle tracks, pedestrian bridges and underpasses; and carrying out feasibility and detailed engineering design studies of roads adjoining major towns and studies for improvement of traffic flows through provision of technical advisory services. The second component is the support to Kenya Urban Roads Authority (KURA) and Kenya Railways Corporation (KRC) to develop selected mass transit corridors. The activities under this component of the project, which include carrying out feasibility studies and detailed engineering designs and preparation of bidding and contract documents for works and associated facilities as well as selection of private sector operators to provide large capacity buses for a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system and rolling stock for a commuter rail system are a precursor for a successor project. Finally, the third component is the institutional strengthening and capacity building. This component will support and deepen the implementation of reforms in the transport sector with a major focus on urban transport."

The DPC2 reinforces reform areas supported by the First Development Policy Credit (DPC1) and builds the earlier policy-based operations. The DPC2 is aligned with World Bank's strategic directions set out in the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS, FY11-14). The main risks are: (a) aggregate demand pressures could linger resulting in persistent rupee shortage. Mitigating factors include: recent monetary and fiscal tightening; a calibration of capital spending by the Royal Government of Bhutan, or RGoB based on foreign grants or loans; and commitment at high levels of the RGoB (in close coordination between Ministry of Finance, the Royal Monetary Authority, in consultation with the World Bank) to targets as evidenced by quarterly review of macroeconomic performance. The expansion of the existing line of credit with the Government of India as well as the currency swap arrangement should help ease pressures on the rupee; (b) capacity constraints due to the small scale of government, mitigated by the RGoB's ongoing capacity building efforts (in many areas supported by development partners); and (c) political risk of changing government priorities, mitigated by the RGoB's wide consultations on the development agenda and its commitment to sustaining reforms."

There are three components to the project, the first component being institutional strengthening of the Niger Basin Authority, or NBA. This component will enhance the NBA's capacity for project supervision of International Development Association, or IDA-funded project activities and support the institutional strengthening of regional water resources management. The second component is the construction of the Kandadji program energy infrastructure. Finally, the third component is the implementation of environmental and social safeguards, and growth pole community development. This component will support resource planning and community development and provide a number lessons learned and practice on the local development of a growth pole program in a context of: (a) zone experiencing influx of refugees, and (b) a paradigm shift in integration of the benefits of major infrastructure in the local development timely to fully exploit all opportunities."

There are four components to the project. The first component is increasing equitable access. The objective of this component is to reduce number of out-of-school children in selected under-served areas through provision of access to formal primary education with grants to learning centers and education allowances to eligible students. This component will finance: (i) grants and allowances, and (ii) ROSC Pilot in selected urban areas. The second component is enhancing education quality. The objective of this component is to improve retention in and completion of primary education cycle through three sub-components: (i) teacher development, (ii) classroom support, and (iii) prevocational skills training pilot for eligible ROSC students. Institute of Education Research (IER) of Dhaka University has been identified to serve as a training agency to support the project on teacher development and classroom support. The third component is improving project management and capacity. The objectives of this component are to establish an effective project implementation structure and enhance project implementation capacity through mobilization of communities and involvement of capable partner agencies to deliver quality primary education to out-of-school children. This component comprises: (i) project management and capacity building, and (ii) social awareness and advocacy. The fourth component is monitoring and evaluation. The objective of this component is to establish an effective monitoring and evaluation system to monitor inputs, processes and outputs, and assess the impact in relation to the stated project development objectives. This component comprises (a) monitoring of inputs, process and outputs, and (b) evaluation of ROSC interventions including learning assessment pilots and impact evaluation of specific ROSC interventions."

This project paper seeks the approval of the Executive Directors to provide an additional credit, with an extension of the original closing date by six months, in an amount of SDR 15.8 million (US$24 million equivalent) to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. This Second Additional Financing (AF) under the project is to help meet increased financing requirements for the procurement of Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV) necessary to implement the National Emergency Action Plan 2012 for Polio Eradication in Pakistan. The Government of Pakistan (GoP) through the Economic Affairs Division (EAD) letter dated June 15, 2012 has requested the Bank to provide additional financing to continue the support to GoP's PEI. With the AF for the TPPEP, International Development Association (IDA) will continue its support in partnership with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) with support from the UN technical agencies: World Health Organization (WHO) and the United National Children's Fund (UNICEF). The GoP appreciates that there may not be a 'buy down' arrangement as there has been in the past. However, the BMGF has expressed an interest to provide funds to an IDA administered TF for extending the 'buy down' mechanism for the additional financing."

      "cdata": "The development objective of the Bihar Panchayat Strengthening Project for India is to support the state government in promoting inclusive, responsive and accountable Panchayat Raj Institutions (PRI) in six districts. There are five components to the project. The first component is Panchayat Sarkar Bhawan. This component involves construction and making functional Panchayat Sarkar Bhawans in approximately 300 gram panchayats. The second component is capacity building for Panchayat Raj Institutions. This component builds panchayats' core institutional competencies to empower them to achieve substantive development outcomes. The component also engages communities and citizens, through training, mobilization, and media, to participate in local governance and to hold panchayats accountable. The third component is strengthening the state government capacity to manage a gradual decentralization and empowerment process. This component will strengthen the state government capacity to manage a gradual decentralization and empowerment process. The fourth component is panchayat performance grant. The annual best panchayat grant will reward exceptional panchayats that are inclusive, responsive and accountable. The recipients of the grant will be selected on a competitive basis. The competition criteria will include core institutional quality indicators related to how a panchayat runs its administration, how it interacts with its citizens, and how it manages resources and promotes local development. The competition will be based on objective information collected through the project information system with a validation process. Annually, the project will recognize the best gram panchayat in each district and block, and award them block grants, which are significantly higher than what they currently receive. The project will support this league of good panchayats to develop high impact initiatives that the grants will finance. The fifth component is project management and coordination. Government of Bihar (GoB) has established a Bihar Gram Swaraj Yojana Society (BGSYS) as the implementation agency for the project. The society is expected to play four critical roles: (i) A catalyst role: public awareness campaign, policy advocacy, innovative capacity building for visible development results, proactive partnership with Non-government Organizations (NGOs) to stimulate demand for accountability and improve PRI responsiveness; (ii) a technical support role: to support partner line departments to establish capacity in managing the devolution process and building PRIs capacity in the relevant service delivery area; (iii) a coordination role: coordinate, monitor and report on the devolution and PRI strengthening process; and (iv) a fiduciary role: project financing management, procurement and reporting. This component will finance staffing and operational cost of the society."

There are two components to the project, the first component being institutional improvement agreements. The objectives of this component will be: (i) to help public universities increase access by investing in infrastructure for teaching, learning and research; (ii) to increase the quality of higher education by, among others, upgrading faculty qualifications and fostering evaluation and accreditation; (iii) to increase relevance in higher education by focusing resources on priority subjects that are key to the country's development; and (iv) to strengthen public universities' management capacity and accountability. Finally, the second component is strengthening institutional capacity for quality enhancement. This component includes three sub-components: (a) strengthening the national system for the accreditation of higher education; (b) developing the labor market observatory and the public higher education information system; and (c) supporting the project's coordination, supervision, and evaluation."

There are three components to the project, the first component being expansion and rehabilitation of school infrastructure. This component consists of the following: i) expansion of the full-time school model through: (a) the construction, transformation and/or rehabilitation of approximately forty (40) schools located primarily in disadvantaged locations and selected in accordance with the criteria set forth in the operational manual; and (b) the acquisition of equipment and education materials for the full-time schools mentioned in (a) herein; and ii) carrying out of preventive and corrective maintenance activities in full-time schools. The second component is the strengthening of learning systems. This component will help achieve the Project Development Objective (PDO) through strengthening systems for improved learning and instruction, in the classroom and beyond. The establishment of a new entity within Preschool and Primary Education Council (CEIP) to provide systematic and permanent in-service teacher training to the entire teaching body in preschool and primary grades, as well as school directors and inspectors, will lead to a more efficient operation of teacher training by National Administration for Public Education (ANEP). Finally, the third component is the monitoring, evaluation and project management."

The project will integrate (that is, mainstream) children with disabilities into their community hub-schools and into community social activities. It will achieve this through local planning to apply national policies for inclusion of children with disabilities and through 20 demonstration (pilot) sub-projects to adapt mainstream schools, and to educate teachers and parents. The project could trigger additional financing from donors by demonstrating practical ways to apply progressive policy at the local level, the project will open the way for other donors and for Ministry of Education (MoE) to fund the integration of children with disabilities in further hub schools."

The design of this operation has benefited from close collaboration with the Government, development partners, Civil Society Organizations (CSOs), and various stakeholders. This operation builds on the decentralization and public sector reforms supported by previous and ongoing World Bank operations. It targets key medium term challenges to improving the quality of service delivery to Rwandan citizens. In recognition of the limited citizen participation and ownership of the development process, the Government has identified the decentralization process as the key focus for its accountable governance reforms. The Bank proposes this operation under challenging circumstances and a fluid aid environment. The financing provided through this operation will help the Government maintain public expenditures and service delivery in priority areas that are relevant for poverty reduction. In addition, while a lack of financial resources may also reduce the Government's ability to implement planned reforms, this operation will help the Government maintain momentum in important reform areas such as capacity building, public financial management (PFM) and social accountability."

The additional financing will help fund the costs associated with scale-up activities and additional similar activities to enhance the impact of the CLRP. Expanding the CLRP works under the proposed Additional Financing would help the Government of Kosovo (GoK) to further address legacy issues related to tar deposits/tar sludge at the gasification site of the Kosovo Energy Corporation J.S.C. (KEK), tree planting at overburden areas, and assist the Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning (MESP) in the identification, monitoring and assessment of environmental and social impacts related to the Kosovo Power Project."

The project has three components. The first component is strategic national program support. This component aims to strengthen the national institutional and financial framework for climate resilience for providing the basis for long-term transformational change in Zambia and helping support the secretariats umbrella role in overseeing and monitoring the national program and in particular the Strategic Pilot Program for Climate Resilience (SPCR). It includes the following two sub-components: (i) institutional support to national climate change program; and (ii) strengthened climate information. The second component is support to participatory adaptation. This component will strengthen the adaptive capacity of vulnerable rural communities in the Barotse sub-basin, through: facilitation and strengthening of community decision-making; technical support to Western Province and district councils; and incremental project management support to Western Province and district councils. The third component is pilot participatory adaptation. This component will fund actual participatory adaptation investments in the Barotse sub-basin. It includes following three sub-components: (1) community adaptation sub-grants; (2) adaptation contingency fund; and (3) rehabilitation and strengthened management of traditional canals."

Achieving the project development objective (PDO) will require investments in infrastructure combined with strengthening of the legal and regulatory framework and capacity building (technical, organizational, financial) of the principal actors at all levels (central, provincial, and city) charged with planning and delivering basic services. The project will support the establishment of accountability between local authorities (nominated mayors, to be elected in the future) and city inhabitants centered on a local development plan (LDP) flowing from a participatory priority-setting process. The primary infrastructure component (US$50 million) will finance investments to rehabilitate or construct major socio-economic infrastructure in project cities, in coordination with investments being implemented by the central and provincial governments to strengthen the cities role as centers of economic growth. The urban governance component (US$48 million) aims to improve urban governance at both national and local levels while improving municipal and urban management and fiscal performance."

The project has four components. The first component is improvement and asset management of the East-West highway. It has following five sub-components: (i) upgrading of existing East-West highway through the construction of a 2-lane dual carriageway from Agara to Zemo Osiauri; (ii) maintenance of the E60 2-lane dual carriageway between Natakhtari and Ruisi; (iii) civil works to improve road safety and access roads on the existing East-West highway between Natakhtari and Ruisi (67km) and along the existing E60 alignment between Ruisi and Chumateleti (44km); (iv) environmental improvement measures along completed sections of the E60 highway between Natakhtari and Ruisi (67km); and (v) construction supervision and quality assurance services. The second component is institutional strengthening. This component provides for the financing of activities to further deepen institutional strengthening efforts being carried out under ongoing bank supported projects. The activities are as follows: (a) institutional strengthening of the MRDI to help the following activities: review and updating of road sector strategy, support to the MRDI to improve road safety management capacity, support to the MRDI to improve the operating environment for the local construction industry, and measures to improve manpower planning and development in MRDI; (b) institutional strengthening of the RD to help organizational efficiency improvement and manpower planning and development measures, and development of a strategic roadmap for the development and implementation of Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) along the East West highway corridor, from Tbilisi to Turkish border. The third component is preparation of designs and supporting studies for future projects for the development of the East-West highway. This component will finance activities for the definition and design of civil works included in component A of the proposed project and preparatory studies for the future westward upgrading of the E60. The planned activities include: (1) study to define the scope of the maintenance interventions along some upgraded sections of the E60 2-lane dual carriageway e.g. Natakhtari to Ruisi (67 kilometers); (2) road safety improvement studies and designs; (3) update of feasibility studies and undertaking of preliminary engineering design of new Rikoti tunnel and 60km of highway between Chumateleti and Argveta; and (4) detailed design of the new tunnel at Rikoti, preparation of bidding documents and independent review of all technical and safety provisions. The fourth component is project management. This component had two sub-components: implementation support to RD; and financial audits and project monitoring and evaluation services."
